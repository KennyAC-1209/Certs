Earning my CompTIA Network+ certification gave me a solid, real-world understanding of how networks actually work and how to fix them when something goes wrong. Through this experience, I became comfortable troubleshooting everyday connectivity issues, whether on wired or wireless networks, and figuring out the root cause quickly. I also learned how to set up and support common network equipment like routers, switches, and access points while following best practices. On top of that, the certification introduced me to important security concepts such as firewalls, VPNs, and access control, helping me understand how to keep users connected and protected.
